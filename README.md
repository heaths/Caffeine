# Caffeine

[![Build status](https://dev.azure.com/heaths/public/_apis/build/status/Caffeine-CI)](https://dev.azure.com/heaths/public/_build/latest?definitionId=11)

Caffeine is a program to keep your monitor or system awake, or to cancel or postpone a system shutdown request while actively using your system.

This is a rewrite of my old [developer code sample](https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/Caffeine-c9988981) using modern function recommendations with new functionality.
